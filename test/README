TOC:
* guitest is needed for the gtk testing. for more information, look at the README in the guitest folder
* mintUploadTesting.py
* test_service.py: tests for the default upload service
* test_template.py: a template to create tests
* testFile_*.* are files designed for upload tests


USAGE:
Starting a test is quite easy:
# python test_*.py
where * represents the test you want to start.

In this default configuration, the test scripts look for mintUpload in the parent directory (e.g. /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintupload). It is possible to modify this behavior with the ‘-p PATH’ CLI option. PATH is added at the end of the parent directory to look for mintUpload.
Example:

    * parent directory = /usr/lib/linuxmint/mintupload/
    * PATH = ../../../../home/user/mydevelopmentstuff/mintupload

as a result, the scripts look for mintUpload in /home/user/mydevelopmentstuff/mintupload
